Care Transition Efficiency & Placement Outcome Analytics

📖 Overview
This project analyzes the child care pipeline — from CBP custody to HHS care and sponsor placements — using Python (Pandas) for preprocessing and Power BI for visualization. The goal is to measure efficiency, identify bottlenecks, and provide actionable insights through interactive dashboards.

🔹 Features
Data Preprocessing (Python/Pandas)
Cleaning raw data
Calculating inflow, exits, backlog rates
Exporting processed CSV (UAC_processed.csv)

🔹 Power BI Dashboard
KPI Cards: Transfer Efficiency, Discharge Effectiveness, Pipeline Throughput, Backlog Rate
Trend Line Chart: Sponsor placement effectiveness over time
Backlog Trend Chart: Inflow vs Exits comparison
Pipeline Stage Volume Chart: Children in CBP custody, HHS care, and discharged
Yearly Comparison Chart: Long-term inflow vs exits
